Introduction
Nd-Fe-B magnets are the strongest permanent magnets widely used in consumer electronics, renewable energy, and industrial applications. While Selective Laser Melting (SLM) offers flexibility in producing complex geometries, the method often results in suboptimal magnetic properties due to microstructural defects like cracks and pores.

This study addresses these challenges by employing annealing and grain boundary diffusion using low-melting-point alloys.

Objectives
To fabricate Nd-Fe-B magnets using the SLM technique.
To enhance magnetic properties (e.g., coercivity, remanence, and saturation magnetization) through annealing.
To study the effects of low-melting-point alloy diffusion on the microstructure and magnetic properties.
Methodology
Fabrication: Nd-Fe-B magnets were fabricated using the SLM 280HL model, leveraging a 400W fiber laser with precision scanning capabilities.
Annealing: Multiple low-melting-point alloys (e.g., LaCe, Nd-Cu, DyCu, DyAlCu) were used for grain boundary diffusion.
Vacuum Conditions: Samples were annealed at temperatures ranging from 550°C to 900°C.
Two-Step Annealing: A combination of high-temperature diffusion followed by low-temperature annealing.
Analysis: Magnetic properties were measured using a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). Microstructural changes were observed through Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM).
Results and Discussion
Improved Coercivity: Annealing with LaCe and Nd-Cu powders significantly enhanced coercivity (e.g., 0.97T to 1.1T).
Microstructural Densification: SEM images revealed reduced cracks and pores after annealing.
Challenges with Strip Alloys: Diffusion of eutectics in strip form (e.g., DyCu) was less effective compared to powders.
Optimization: A two-step annealing process showed better results in achieving uniform diffusion and improved properties.
Key Findings
SLM Fabrication Challenges: Microstructural defects negatively impact magnetic properties.
Annealing Enhancements:
LaCe and Nd-Cu powders showed significant improvements in coercivity and remanence.
Two-stage annealing optimized diffusion and minimized grain growth.
Future Directions: Additional characterizations, like XPS analysis, can provide deeper insights into the effects of annealing.
